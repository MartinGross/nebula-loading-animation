## Code Style Guidelines

### TypeScript

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Provide proper type definitions
- Use interfaces for props and configuration objects
- Export types from the main index file

### React Components

- Use functional components with hooks
- Follow React best practices
- Use proper prop validation with TypeScript
- Include accessibility attributes (ARIA labels, roles)

### Naming Conventions

- Use PascalCase for component names
- Use camelCase for variables and functions
- Use UPPER_SNAKE_CASE for constants
- Use descriptive names that explain the purpose

### Code Organization

- Keep components focused and single-purpose
- Extract reusable logic into custom hooks
- Use constants for magic numbers and strings
- Group related functionality together

## Testing

### Writing Tests

- Write unit tests for all new functionality
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- Mock external dependencies
- Use descriptive test names

### Running Tests

```bash
npm run test          # Run all tests
npm run test:watch    # Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:coverage # Generate coverage report
```

## Documentation

### Code Documentation

- Use JSDoc comments for functions and classes
- Document complex logic with inline comments
- Keep README.md up to date
- Update API documentation for changes

### Examples

- Provide usage examples for new features
- Update the demo application
- Add integration examples for popular frameworks

## Pull Request Process

### Before Submitting

1. Ensure all tests pass
2. Run the linter and fix any issues
3. Update documentation
4. Test the demo application
5. Add/update examples if needed

### PR Requirements

- **Clear description**: Explain what changes you made and why
- **Issue reference**: Link to relevant issues if applicable
- **Breaking changes**: Clearly mark any breaking changes

### Review Process

1. Automated checks must pass (CI/CD)
2. Code review by maintainers
3. Address feedback and requested changes
4. Final approval and merge

## Release Process
